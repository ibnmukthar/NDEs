# Neural Differential Equations Repository

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to exploring Neural Differential Equations (NDEs), a cutting-edge intersection of neural networks and differential equations. The focus is on programming neural differential equations and comparing their performance and characteristics with traditional neural networks. This essay was written to satisfy the requirements of the MA395 Essay module at the Warwick Mathematics Institute.

## Contents
- **NDE Implementations**: Code and notebooks showcasing the implementation of various types of neural differential equations.
- **Comparison Studies**: Comparative analyses between NDEs and traditional neural networks in various scenarios.
- **Data Sets**: Data used for training and testing the models.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanation of the methodologies and algorithms used.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-link]`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Explore the notebooks and scripts in the `src` directory.
