# Neural Differential Equations Repository

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to exploring Neural Differential Equations (NDEs), a cutting-edge intersection of neural networks and differential equations. The focus is on programming neural differential equations and comparing their performance and characteristics with traditional neural networks.

## Contents
- **NDE Implementations**: Code and notebooks showcasing the implementation of various types of neural differential equations.
- **Comparison Studies**: Comparative analyses between NDEs and traditional neural networks in various scenarios.
- **Data Sets**: Data used for training and testing the models.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanation of the methodologies and algorithms used.

## Getting Started
